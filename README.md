### **Nodemon**

nodemon is a usefull library that allows your server to start up whenever you save your code. On default you would have to restart your server in the terminal every time you make changes to the server code. With nodemon it restarts automatically. I believe you can use this with other programming languages not just javascript

### **Installation**

I have nodemon globally installed. the below is how you do it

> npm install -g nodemon

If you want it to just to be a development dependency you can run the below in your terminal

> nom install --save-dev nodemon

### **Create package.json file**

The package.json file holds some basic information about your application as well as metadata about your app. It will also manage all the dependencies of your application. Any additional package you install using NPM (Node Package Manager) will be managed here as well.

Use the below command to created the file

> npm init

you can add -y to answer yes to all the questions it asks you about your project

> npm init -y
