# Problem Solving Approach and Patterns

**What is an Algorithm**

- An Algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
- As a programmer almost everything you do has to do with some type of algorithm
- foundation of being a successful problem solver and developer

**How do you improve in problem solving and algorithms**

1. devise a plan for solving problems
2. master common problem solving patterns

**steps in solving a problem**

1. understand the problem
   - Can I restate the roblem in my own words
   - what are the inputs that go into the problem
   - what are the outputs that should come from the solution of a problem
   - cant he putpute be determined from the inputs
   - how should i label the important pieces of data that are used to solve the problem
2. explore concrete examples
3. break it down
4. solve/ simplify
5. look back and refactor
